I think about my own existence. I am not going to live a very long life. For I cannot guarantee the future. I think we all comtemplate death from time to time, it is a nature state to be in when you have so much time on your hands. Survival; to aid in survival, we think about what would happen if we died and that drives us forward.

When I look at society, I do not see a well oiled machine, I do not see a free and humble creature. My mental imagery of society is that of war and chaos, for that is the invetiable of human nature. Even with advancements in technology and education we still find a way to bicker about things that could be solved in a day if we simply realized our own mortalilty. What is the purpose of chaos, if not to bring about a state of order. Many leaders have a misconception of what order truly is; order in my view is when one controls only what is needed to be controlled. When a leader can determine in an instant what has to be handle and what does not it is a striking. It sends shivers down the spine because of that authority. To turn authoritarian is a mistake, it always has been, to create order we have to understand our people, and not move outside of what we know. To go out of our own realm of knowledge and not advise one of wisdom is foolish, and only leads to an iron grip that chokes away at society. A humble, and understanding leader surrounds themselves with people who inform there decisions in a way that is new, refreshing, and insightful. To be surrounded by opinions all akin to your own is not useful when governing bodies of knowledge that you are not expert in.

Mentally and physically we are all degrading. It takes courage to say that we are breaking apart but, it takes even more to do something about it. My body is in a constant state of pain, but that is what fuels me. Every nerve ending is sprayed like a wire. No painkiller can solve my pain. For even if it may feel physical, it is also spiritual, mental, and thus, there would be no release but death itself. I do not believe that death is an answer to pain, in fact I believe that death only causes more pain for those around you.

Mentally, I find myself in an isolated and dissociated state. I haven't felt like a person in years, and now I feel as though every action I take is meaningless. Every time I attempt to do something, I end up failing. I understand that one must learn from failure, but if everyone believes that I am a failure, it can lead to a state of paralysis. A proper support network is essential, and I am referring to more than just casual conversations. It is not sufficient; we must encourage one another to step outside our comfort zones. This does not mean forcing anyone, but rather gently guiding them toward opportunities for growth.

The critical thing to remember is that I can only escape my own struggles if I truly want to. You cannot help someone who does not wish to be helped. I find that I do not want anyone else's assistance; I seek to come to my own understanding of life.

I have worked diligently to be a good person, but I have come to realize that the concepts of good and evil are subjective. For instance, I personally believe I am a terrible person, not because I wish to be, but because I have been surrounded by abuse for so long. The only logical outcome of my circumstances is to accept them and become like my environment.

You are defined by those you surround yourself with, and I believe that all my friends are good people. However, in my family, I am surrounded by dishonesty and deceit, which makes me feel as though it is an "If you can't beat them, join them" situation. I could engage in that behavior, but I would lose my sense of self in the process. I cannot pretend that "everything is okay."

In reality, everything is clearly not okay. I look around and see everything deteriorating, with no one speaking up because "everything is okay." I understand that human beings often struggle to think ahead, but we must not deceive ourselves.

We are intelligent individuals. Let us not avoid the truth. We know that our situation is troubling. We recognize that our future does not appear promising, and I understand that many choose to retreat into their own worlds because they feel uncertain about what to do.

However, I have hope and believe that we, as a community, can change our circumstances because we are the future. My only challenge is that I am in such a state of profound depression that I feel it is better to remain still than to move forward. Yet, I know that this is not the right approach; I just do not know how to escape my current situation. I need help. I would be immensely grateful if you could assist me in finding a reason to live and continue moving forward.

I cannot live for money, fame, or power. I cannot live for the love of my friends or family. I have tried to do so, and it worked for years, but it no longer motivates me. I struggle with self-acceptance and lack confidence in myself, so I need to find assurance in something greater.

Whenever I attempt to make a prediction, I hope to be wrong. Have you ever heard me make an optimistic prediction? I do not wish to predict the future; that is not my goal, but I want to be prepared for it. Perhaps this is something that is unclear to everyone.
